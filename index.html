    <p> Overwhelming. It best describes the final chapter that culminates Marvel Cinematic Universe’s 21 iconic films into one. And that also describes the experience of watching your favourite superheroes come together for a singular goal, for one last time. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo ensure that the humongous build-up and the avalanche of expectations do not get the better of them. They deliver a largely wholesome product that is full of moments laced with action, emotion, comedy and drama. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely take you along, even if you haven’t been following the franchise. They do an incredible job with the screenplay to balance emotions with visual spectacle. So if you’re not a fan yet, chances are, you might become one after watching this instalment.
       While the screen time for each character is not equal, their significance in the story is. And there are enough surprises in store, as far as their fates are concerned. ‘Endgame’ delivers quite well on the emotional quotient, bringing out superpowers and vulnerabilities of its cinematic demigods through their measured performances. From an upright Captain America (Chris Evans) to a stoic Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and from a straight-faced Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) delivering the punches to the reassuring presence of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), ‘Endgame’ has it all and a lot more. Thanks to the conviction in performances, you also might just find yourself rooting for the bad guy, Thanos (Josh Brolin) at some point. However, it’s the comic collective of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Ant Man (Paul Rudd) that ensures there are enough lighter moments in this otherwise heartfelt finale.

     <p> 2019’s The Lion King is a ‘live action’ remake of the 1994 original animation flick which went on to become an iconic film for all ages. Those who have watched the original Lion King will vouch for its strong emotional connect, rousing, heartbreaking moments that left a lasting impression and of course the legendary soundtrack and background score.
        So does the 2019 version of Lion King match up? (In India, the film is releasing in four languages – English and also dubbed in Hindi, Tamil and Telegu.) The big draw of course of the Hindi dubbed version is actor Shah Rukh Khan as Mufasa and Aryan Khan as Simba. The father and son duo had earlier lent their voices to the Hindi dubbed version of The Incredibles in 2004.
        2019’s Lion King is a visual extravaganza to savor. Everything you see on screen is etched out with spellbinding detailing and the visual finesse gives way to near perfection. Some scenes especially ones with the fire flies in the night, open starlit skies and expansive views of the forest look stunning. Where the visual appeal falls short is in the expressions and emotions on the faces, especially the eyes of the animals which the animated version had got so right. So while you do feel sad when Mufasa is killed, you are not particularly moved to tears like with the original. And while Scar looks evil, he is not menacing. Also though the film is thirty minutes lengthier it pretty much remains an almost scene by scene copy of the 1994 version, losing its potential to surprise and intrigue further.
        However, the principal voice cast is a delight – Shah Rukh Khan as Mufasa is captivating from the word go, Aryan Khan shines as the young Simba – capturing every emotion perfectly. The scene where Simba speaks to his father’s reflection in the water, with Mufasa’s voice emanating from the sky stands out as a whole – visually and otherwise. Ashish Vidyarthi as Scar is particularly good, his voice adding the required dimension to the character.Perhaps to contextualize andgive it a local flavor Pumbaa (Sanjay Mishra) and Timon (Shreyas Talpade) speak in tapori hindi here – so there is a generous sprinkling of ‘Bhai’ ‘Jhakaas’ ‘ Apun’ ‘Bindass’. And the gang of hyenas speak in Bhojpuri.While it may connect with the audience and elucidate some laughs, it robs the classic film of some of its original flavor.
        Shreya Ghosal, Arman Malik and Sunayna Sarkar do a fine job with the Hindi renditions of the soundtrack. But for those who have reveled in the original 'Circle of Life', 'Can you feel the Love tonight' and 'Hakuna Matata' it may not match up totally. The background score by Hans Zimmer is one of the high points of the film.
        For those who haven’t seen the original, 'The Lion King' (2019) is certainly worth a watch for its gorgeous visuals and technical genius and one’s catching it in Hindi will have Shah Rukh Khan and Aryan Khan adding their spark.

      “India has done substantially well in the last All India Tiger Estimation but we have to see how every state performed. Only seven to eight states are responsible for the increase in the numbers, but most states have let down the tiger. This has happened largely because of habitat degradation, huge pressure of rapid development, and dependence of people on forests,” he said, adding that country has habitat to support about 10,000 tigers. He said the approximate figures from around 100 years ago show India had 40,000 tigers then, compared to which, the current numbers are very low.</p>

      <p class="p_modal">The story is about a boy named Danny. He lost his mother when he was four months old. His father William took care of him. He and his father lived in an old caravan. His father runned a filling station and owned and operated a garage for a living.  By the age of 5, Danny started helping his father in the garage. One day, his father promised to return home by 10 ‘o’ clock at night. Awaiting his father, Danny went to sleep. When he suddenly woke up around 2 AM, he didn’t find his father. He searched for his father everywhere. Danny then drove a car in search of his father. Finally he found his father at Hazel Woods. Danny’s father was in a trap. Danny rescued his father. After reaching home, his father revealed that he was a poacher and went to Hazel woods for illegal poaching of pheasants, that too after ten years. He revealed his family's secret methods of poaching without using guns. Danny and his father decided to embarrass Mr.Hazel in his annual pheasants shoot by capturing all the pheasants in the forest.
        They decided to keep  the sleeping pills prescribed by Doctor Doc Spencer to Danny’s father inside the raisins for pheasants to eat. Danny and his father succeeded in capturing 120 pheasants.They hid the pheasants at a vicarage for that night. Next day, the vicar’s wife delivered the pheasants at Danny’s father’s garage. When the effect pills weared off, the pheasants flew out of the carriage.
        
        Mr.Hazel red head the place and confronted Danny and his father. With the help of the village police man, Danny and his father shooed away the birds. The birds sat over Mr.Hazel’s Rolls Royce and damaged the car’s paint. Mr.Hazel felt disgraced. Later the pheasants flew away as they woke up. Everyone became sad
        
        In the conclusion, Danny’s father calls him the champion of the world for his unique ‘sleeping pills’ idea. Later they found 6 dead pheasants. It was divided between Danny and his father, Vicar’s wife,the policeman and the doctor. At the end Danny and his father went to the market to buy a new oven while discussing new methods  of pheasants poaching on the way.
        
        
        
        The story is about a small poor boy named Danny and his father who lived in a caravan. The characters of the story are Danny, Williams, his father, Mrs.Clipstone the vicar’s wife, Doc Spencer the doctor, the policeman and Mr.Victor Hazell.
        
        The part I liked the most was that of hunting of pheasants by Danny and his father. I enjoyed the hunting procedure of Danny and his father. The only part I didn’t enjoy was the escape of the majority pheasants  from Danny and his father.
        
        Book Rating- 7.5/10  ★★★★★★★
        
        The book could have been better if the illustrator brush-ups his illustration. The illustrations should have been like the book ‘Matilda’ which is also illustrated by the same illustrator.  
        
        The story was very straightforward. There could be 2-3 plots. 
        
        Otherwise this book was excellent and I would definitely recommend it to people who like simple stories.

        <p class="p_modal">After Shree accepted the invitation from Chaitra to come to the railway station, she was feeling uncomfortable. So she told the whole story to her class  teacher. After hearing everything, she told that there is no school near them. The teacher told  that the person might be an imposter and she needs to be more careful. The teacher advised her not to trust that person anymore. They need to find out the culprit.Till then Shree was told to pretend  as a true friend to that anonymous person. Also she should not tell that she had shared all the incidents with her teacher.

          Shree followed her teacher’s advice without fail.
          
          Meanwhile, the teacher informed this matter to the principal. The school reported it to the cyber police. The cyber police collected information from Shree as well as from her PC. Later on, the deceiver was identified. It was a lady who is an agent supplying young girls to a human trafficking racket. The lady was arrested.
          She felt relieved. After that Shree decided to spend her leisure time effectively rather than sitting in the front of the computers. The school arranged a counselling session for all the children regarding internet safety.
          
          My favourite part -The man was caught because Akka made a great move to step up to hit him who tried to cheat and touch Shree. Her action was spontaneous. It  truly exceeded my expectation as I never thought that a lady like Akka who always loves to nap while the television would even try to hit a man in public.
